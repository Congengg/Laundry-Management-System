# Laundry-Management-System
DAD MINI PROJECT

Introduction

Project Overview: A brief description of the project, its purpose, and the problem it solves.

Commercial Value / Third-Party Integration: Explain the project's potential in a real-world market OR detail the external APIs used (e.g., Google Maps, Firebase Authentication) and justify their integration.

System Architecture

High-Level Diagram: A visual representation (e.g., a block diagram) showing how all components interact: the two frontend apps, the backend server, the database, and any external services. This provides a clear overview of the distributed system.

Backend Application

Technology Stack: List the programming language, framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django), and other key libraries used.

API Documentation: This is the most critical part. It should include:

(1) A list of all API endpoints (e.g., /api/books, /api/users/login).

(2) The HTTP method for each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

(3) Required request parameters, headers, and body formats (with JSON examples).

(4) Example success and error responses (with status codes and JSON examples).

(5) Security: Detail the security measures implemented. Explain the choice of mechanism (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0, API Keys) and describe how it protects the endpoints.

Frontend Applications

For each of the two frontend apps:

Purpose: Describe the app's function and target user (e.g., one app for customers, one for administrators).

Technology Stack: List the frameworks and libraries used (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js, Swift, Kotlin).

API Integration: Explain how the frontend communicates with the backend API.

Database Design

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): A diagram showing the database tables, their columns (with data types), and the relationships between them (one-to-one, one-to-many).

Schema Justification: Briefly explain why the database was designed this way, highlighting key tables and relationships.

Business Logic and Data Validation

Use Case Diagrams/Flowcharts: Illustrate the main user flows, such as "selecting a book," "borrowing a book," and "returning a book." This visually demonstrates the business logic.

Data Validation: Describe the validation rules implemented on both the frontend (e.g., checking for empty fields) and backend (e.g., ensuring an email is unique).
